The app directory must include a root layout.
The root layout must define <html> and <body> tags since Next.js does not automatically create them.
You can use the head.js special file to manage <head> HTML elements, for example, the <title> element.
The root layout is a Server Component by default and can not be set to a Client Component.*/
